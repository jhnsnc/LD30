Brainstorm / Game Ideas
-----------------------
Tag team platformer (light side / shadow side)
Tower defense game (switch between internal battle and outside battle, with progress on one siding giving benefits or penalties to the other side based on performance)
Asteroid defense-like game (stuffed animals protecting child while she sleeps)
Strategy game where you have to play from both sides (so you don't want other side to win too much)
- tower defense?
- puzzle game?

Note at time of initial release
-------------------------------
Obviously with all the rush to get things done, a lot of stuff just didn't get documented or changed significantly from what you may see written.

Browse this source code at your own risk: it has a lot of hacks and inconsistencies and overall wonkiness due to the speed at which it was thrown together.
